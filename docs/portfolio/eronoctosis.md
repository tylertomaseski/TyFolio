### Idea Formation
Eronoctosis was born from the depths of our collective subconscious in late spring of 2021. After a year of pandemic-induced isolation, we wanted to build a co-op game that had the intensity and atmosphere of our favorite single-player psychological horror games. On top of that, we couldn't resist adding a layer of mystery to make players puzzle over the meaning of their time in the game.

## My Role

* Core Developer
* Technical Producer
* Designer

For Eronoctosis I designed the core concept, developed the character controller, multiplayer code, and almost anything that isn't the AI. **I coordinated the team and our tasks through the original project, its steam release, and the addition of the Devotion DLC.**

### Lessons Learned

* Project management from conception to release without a publisher
* Multiplayer Gameplay Code
* Pipelines for efficient indie content generation
