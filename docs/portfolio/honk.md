## About Game

>HONK is an all-in-one VTuber creation and animation suite. It uses your mic for lip-sync. Honk uses image-swapping instead of rigging. To animate your character, you just redraw you character's mouth and it swaps between the images based on what you say through your mic!

## My Role

* Sole-Developer

I wanted to bring a character of mine, Grombit, to life. But the available character animation and lipsync tools were either overly complicated or overly simple. So, I made my own! I developed HONK between contracts over a couple months and released it on Itch.io under Dream Toaster Games.

## Lessons Learned

* Product management for a self-published tool
* Running community support and rapid releases
* Developing user-facing tools for custom content
