## About Game

>Star Wars: Republic Commando is a tactical first-person shooter video game developed and published by LucasArts. It was released for the Xbox and Microsoft Windows in March 2005.

The game was re-released in 2021 by Aspyr for Switch and PS4. This is the portion I helped steer.

## My Role

* Technical Producer
* Engineer

I put together a pitch, budget, team, and then managed the project to completion as technical producer. The port was for Aspyr and executed and delivered by PolyKnight Games.

I was the lead on the port-team from start to finish.
