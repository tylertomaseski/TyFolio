#### Unity Consultant and Technical Producer with 8-years of work experience. 

I'm looking for work on original titles or console-porting. As a team-lead, technical-producer, or unity-consultant.

I am based out of Dallas TX and am willing to visit the office, but am exclusively looking for remote work.

## About Me Casually

I'm an organizer for <a href="https://societyofplay.net/">Society of Play</a>, a 501(c) Non-Profit gamedev community. Community and giving back is a big part of my pathos. 

Gamedev encompasses my career and most of my hobbies. Be it Society of Play, GameJams, or side-projects, I find myself doing GameDev a lot on my free-time. As for games I play I'm a huge fan of Dark Fantasy, quirky PS1 era games, hidden-role games, and anything exploration forward.

Outside of gamedev? I love building keyboards, perusing art books, visiting any new art-exhibits, being a foodie, music, volunteering for local causes, and volunteering at a local cat shelter.

## About Me Professionally

I'm first and foremost a problem solver and conflict resolver. I'm capable of slotting in as an engineer or putting together teams and bids for projects. Leadership is something I value and something I hone. 

I've most recently been credited as ***Unity Consultant*** and ***Technical Producer***. 

I work under the Dream Toaster Games LLC as a freelancer.
