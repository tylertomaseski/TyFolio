# About Me

## Casually

I'm an organizer for Society of Play, a 501(c) Non-Profit gamedev community. Community and giving back is a big part of my pathos. 

Gamedev encompasses my career and most of my hobbies. Be it Society of Play, GameJams, or side-projects, I find myself doing GameDev a lot on my free-time. As for games I play I'm a huge fan of Dark Fantasy, quirky PS1 era games, hidden-role games, and anything exploration forward.

Outside of gamedev? I love building keyboards, perusing art books, and volunteering at a local cat shelter.

## Professionally

I'm first and formost a problem solver and conflict resolver. I'm capable of slotting in as an engineer or putting together teams and bids for projects. Leadership is something I value and something I hone. I've most recently been credited as ***Unity Consultant*** and ***Technical Producer***. I work under the Dream Toaster Games LLC as a freelancer.
